Face Mask Detection Build a computer vision model that can detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using a dataset of labeled images. Preprocess the images, train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification, and evaluate its accuracy on test images This project successfully demonstrates the application of deep learning to a real-world problem. The system achieves high accuracy (98.18%) through transfer learning with MobileNetV2 and operates reliably in real-time scenarios. The combination of advanced preprocessing, data augmentation, and temporal smoothing results in a robust, production-ready face mask detection system. The project showcases proficiency in:

Deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow/Keras) Computer vision libraries (OpenCV) Model optimization techniques Real-time system development Performance evaluation and metrics analysis
